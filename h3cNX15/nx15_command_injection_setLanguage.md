# Overview

In the `H3C Magic` series products, `H3C Magic NX30 Pro` and `H3C NX400`and H3C NX15  and H3C R3010 and H3C BE18000 allow an attacker to send a specially crafted `POST` request to the `/api/wizard/setLanguage` route without authorization, enabling remote code execution with the highest privileges.



# Vulnerability details

When the route is `/wizard/setLanguage`, it can enter its handler function.

`v14` is user-controllable. Although the `FCGI_CheckStringIfContainsSemicolon` function is used to filter dangerous characters, it fails to filter backticks, leading to command injection.
